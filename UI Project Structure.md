## ✏️ Simple Explanation (Summary)
You're designing a system where toy factory staff can:
- Log in
- View and manage toys (add, edit, delete)
- Upload bulk data
- Get reports using charts
- Sort, search, and filter items
- Secure the app with user roles and login
- Use Postman to test all backend API routes
- Deploy everything online using MongoDB Atlas

The UI will have clear pages like Dashboard, Products, Reports, Settings, and a sidebar to move around easily.
